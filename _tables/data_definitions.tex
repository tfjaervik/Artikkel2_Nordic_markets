\midrule
$r_{t}$ ($r_{m}/r_{f}$) & Return at time t (market return/risk-free rate),the two first in excess
          of the risk-free rate. & TDS, Estimated\\
LTD & Lower tail dependence coefficient of individual stock returns
             and market returns. The coefficient is estimated on daily
             data with 12 month rolling windows. The estimation frequency
             is 1 month. & TDS, Estimated\\
$\beta$ & Covariance between excess stock return and excess market return. 
             Calculated on monthly data. & TDS, Estimated\\
$\beta^{-}$ & Downside beta estimated on daily return data from one year, 
             following Ang, Chen and Xing (2006). It is the the same as $\beta$,
             but calculated conditional on return observations exceeding the 
             mean of the market return observations. & TDS, Estimated\\
$\beta^{+}$ & Upside beta estimated on daily return data from one year, 
          following Ang, Chen and Xing (2006). It is the the same as $\beta$,
          but calculated conditional on return observations being lower than the 
          mean of the market return observations. & TDS, Estimated\\
\addlinespace
Coskewness & The coskewness of the daily return of a stock with the market. & TDS, Estimated\\
Cokurtosis & To cokurtosis of the daily return of a stock with the market & TDS, Estimated\\
size & The logarithm of market capitalization & TDS, Estimated\\
bookmarket & Book value divided by market capitalization, where book value is
          calculated as Total Assets minus Total Liabilities & TDS, Estimated\\
HML & The High minus Low factor from Fama and French (1993). Calculated from monthly
          data from TDS. & TDS, \vphantom{1} Estimated\\
\addlinespace
SMB & The Small minus Big factor from Fama and French (1993). Calculated from monthly
          data from TDS. & TDS, Estimated\\
